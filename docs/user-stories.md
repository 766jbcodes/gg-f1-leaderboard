## Completed

### Leaderboard & core UX
1. **As a user,** I want only the first position in the leaderboard to be visually highlighted and the leaderboard ordered by score, **so that** I can quickly see the leader and trust the ranking.
2. **As a mobile user,** I want the leaderboard and predictions tables to be scrollable and readable on my device, **so that** I can view all data without horizontal scrolling or squinting.
3. **As a new user,** I want a small info icon next to the scoring toggle, **so that** I can quickly understand the difference between the two scoring methods.
4. **As a user,** I want the position difference or a checkmark next to each prediction in the predictions table, **so that** I can see how accurate each pick is.
5. **As a user,** I want correct predictions to be visually highlighted in the predictions table, **so that** I can easily spot perfect picks.
6. **As a desktop user,** I want the current standings to remain visible as I scroll through predictions, **so that** I can compare predictions to real results.
7. **As a user with accessibility needs,** I want buttons and toggles to be keyboard accessible with sufficient colour contrast, **so that** I can use the app comfortably.
8. **As a user,** I want a loading spinner or skeleton in tables while data loads, **so that** I know the app is working.
9. **As a user,** I want a friendly error message and fallback data if the API fails, **so that** I’m not left with a blank page.
10. **As a user,** I want subtle hover and active states on table rows and buttons, **so that** the app feels responsive.

### Predictions tab
11. **As a user,** I want all predictions in a single main tab, **so that** I don’t have to switch tabs to compare users.
12. **As a user,** I want to select a participant (sub-tabs on desktop, dropdown on mobile), **so that** I can focus on one person’s predictions at a time.
13. **As a user,** I want to toggle between Constructors and Drivers predictions for the selected user, **so that** I can compare both types.
14. **As a user,** I want to toggle scoring method (Position Difference or Correct Guesses) while viewing predictions, **so that** I can see how each method affects results.
15. **As a user,** I want a single table showing for each position: current standing, the selected user’s prediction, and the score, **so that** I can compare reality to predictions at a glance.
16. **As a mobile user,** I want the participant selector as a dropdown, **so that** I can switch users easily on a small screen.

### Admin & interface
17. **As an admin,** I want the admin panel protected (e.g. by email allowlist), **so that** only authorised users can access technical features.
18. **As an admin,** I want to see a log of recent API fetches or cache refreshes, **so that** I can monitor system health.
19. **As a user,** I want a cleaner interface without technical API status indicators, **so that** I can focus on F1 data.
20. **As a user,** I want a subtle, space-efficient way to switch scoring methods, **so that** the interface feels less cluttered.
21. **As a user,** I want the interface simplified without participant search/filter, **so that** it stays simple for a small group.
22. **As a user,** I want a cleaner results view with participant scores and minimal controls, **so that** I can understand standings quickly.
23. **As a mobile user,** I want controls to be touch-friendly and appropriately sized, **so that** I can use the app on my device easily.
24. **As a user,** I want clear visual hierarchy, **so that** I can find the most important information first.
25. **As a user,** I want information in digestible chunks with minimal distractions, **so that** I can focus on F1 predictions and results.

### Historical seasons
26. **As a user,** I want to view predictions and results for previous seasons (2023–2025) in the same way as the current season, **so that** I can compare my performance across years.
27. **As a user,** I want final standings for past seasons to be accurate and static, **so that** I can trust the leaderboard.
28. **As a user,** I want to toggle the scoring method for any season, **so that** I can see how different scoring systems affect results.
