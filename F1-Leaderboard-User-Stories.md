# F1 Predictions Leaderboard – User Stories

## Completed Stories ✅
*Stories 1-20 have been completed and implemented*

## 1. Leaderboard Table Highlighting
**As a user, I want only the first position in the leaderboard to be visually highlighted (e.g., bold or slightly larger), and I want the leaderboard to always be ordered by score, so I can quickly recognise the leader and trust the ranking.**

## 2. Mobile Responsiveness
**As a mobile user, I want the leaderboard and predictions tables to be easily scrollable and readable on my device, so I can view all data without horizontal scrolling or squinting.**

## 3. Score Explanation Tooltip
**As a new user, I want to see a small info icon next to the scoring toggle, so I can quickly understand the difference between the two scoring methods.**

## 4. Inline Scoring for Predictions
**As a user, I want to see the position difference or a checkmark next to each prediction in the predictions table, so I can instantly see how accurate each pick is.**

## 5. Highlight Correct Guesses
**As a user, I want correct predictions in the predictions table to be visually highlighted (e.g., green check or subtle highlight), so I can easily spot perfect picks.**

## 6. Sticky Standings (Desktop)
**As a desktop user, I want the current standings to remain visible as I scroll through predictions, so I can always compare predictions to the real results.**

## 7. Accessibility Improvements
**As a user with accessibility needs, I want all buttons and toggles to be keyboard accessible and have sufficient color contrast, so I can use the app comfortably.**

## 8. Loading States for Tables
**As a user, I want to see a loading spinner or skeleton loader in tables while data is loading, so I know the app is working and not broken.**

## 9. Friendly Error Handling
**As a user, I want to see a friendly error message and fallback data if the API fails, so I'm not left with a blank or broken page.**

## 10. Microinteractions
**As a user, I want subtle hover and active states on table rows and buttons, so the app feels responsive and interactive.**

## 11. Personalisation (Optional/Future)
**As a user, I want to favourite a participant or highlight my own predictions, so I can focus on what matters most to me.**

## 12. Shareability (Optional/Future)
**As a user, I want to share the leaderboard or my results on social media, so I can engage friends and increase competition.**

## 13. Admin Panel Access Control
**As an admin, I want to protect the admin panel with a password or token, so only authorised users can access technical features.**

## 14. Admin Logs/History
**As an admin, I want to see a log of recent API fetches or cache refreshes, so I can monitor the health and activity of the system.**

# User-Centric Predictions Tab (New Stories)

## 15. Unified Predictions Tab
**As a user, I want all predictions to be accessible from a single main tab, so I don't have to switch between multiple tabs to compare users.**

## 16. Per-User Sub-Tabs or Dropdown
**As a user, I want to select a participant (via sub-tabs on desktop or a dropdown on mobile), so I can focus on one person's predictions at a time.**

## 17. Prediction Type Toggle
**As a user, I want to toggle between Constructors and Drivers predictions for the selected user, so I can easily compare both types of predictions.**

## 18. Scoring Method Toggle
**As a user, I want to toggle between different scoring methods (Position Difference or Correct Guesses) while viewing predictions, so I can see how each method affects the results.**

## 19. Unified Comparison Table
**As a user, I want to see a single table that shows, for each position: the current standing, the selected user's prediction, and the score for that prediction, so I can directly compare reality to predictions and understand performance at a glance.**

## 20. Mobile-Friendly User Selector
**As a mobile user, I want the participant selector to be a dropdown, so it's easy to switch between users on a small screen.**

# Interface Streamlining & UX Improvements

## 21. Remove API Status Clutter
